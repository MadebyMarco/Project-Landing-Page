# Project-Landing-Page
Landing page project for odin course.

After completing this website I will have shown that I can use flex box, css, and html, to the extent of creating a basic website. 

I realize that I immediately have two large errors. I named both the project and a folder within my project with capital letters, which I am not supposed to do. 

I learned that flex box and aligning items can be very difficult. Fully understanding how properties affect each other and your control is a fun kind of frustration. Overall, learned a lot and had fun.
